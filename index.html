        <p>Here to work on projects with purpose - and to deliver them to audiences with creative, empathetic, and effective leadership.</p>
        <p>I have over a decade of experience leading digital brands and campaigns in the UK audio and music industry - including roles at BBC Radio (combined 7.5 years, spanning all their national networks - including Radio 1, Radio 2, and Radio 4) and Bauer Media (Heat, Greatest Hits Radio, Hits Radio) - starting my career as a radio producer before specialising in social media. My background brings together content strategy, audience growth, and platform innovation - backed by a solid understanding of agile ways of working and leading cross-functional teams.</p>
        <p>Most recently, I was the Senior Social Media Lead for BBC Radio 2, Radio 3 and 6 Music - overseeing creative output for the three national networks, shaping strategy with stakeholders, and empowering my extremely talented team to deliver over 1 billion organic video views in 2024.</p>
        <p>Key projects included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Coverage of flagship BBC live music events (Glastonbury Festival, Radio 2 in the Park, 6 Music Festival, BBC Proms)</li>
            <li>Editorial and platform strategy refreshes for Radio 2 and 6 Music</li>
            <li>Proposing and launching a modern new presence for Radio 3</li>
            <li>The ‘Change The Tune’ moderation initiative on 6 Music - aimed at making online spaces more positive for musicians and fans.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Before that, I was BBC Radio Social's Senior Planner, leading portfolio-wide projects, evolving our approach to prioritisation and performance measurement, developing and testing tactics, and building valuable collaborations across the organisation.</p>

        <p>After taking a career break to travel around Australia, I’m now excited to pursue a career pivot - applying my skills to a product-focused role in the tech space. Whether it’s project management, shaping and communicating digital strategy, driving growth, or team leadership - or a combination of all of those things, I'd love to chat about how I could fit into your team.</p>
